# NARWHAL_NET

**PLAY_TO_LEARN // EVOLVE_TO_EARN**

Welcome to **Narwhal.net**, a decentralized gaming experience built on the **Sui Network**. 

🌊 **Live App**: [https://narwhal-eight.vercel.app/](https://narwhal-eight.vercel.app/)

## 🧬 Project Overview
**Narwhal.net** is a decentralized, interactive gaming experience built on the **Sui Network** that redefines digital ownership through **Dynamic NFTs**. It merges "Play-to-Learn" mechanics with an "Evolve-to-Earn" ecosystem, where users don't just own static assets—they nurture and upgrade them through on-chain actions.

Unlike traditional NFTs that remain unchanged, Narwhals are living digital organisms. They carry unique **DNA** tailored to their owner's wallet address and can mutate through four distinct evolutionary stages: **Base**, **Cyber**, **Mech**, and **Legend**.

## 🕹️ Key Features

### 1. Evolvable Avatars
Your Narwhal is not just a JPEG; it's a stateful object on the Sui blockchain.
- **DNA System**: Each avatar is procedurally generated based on your wallet address, ensuring a unique hue and personality.
- **On-Chain Evolution**: As you participate in the ecosystem, you can trigger 'Evolution' transactions. This updates the metadata on-chain, physically transforming your avatar's skin and traits while retaining its core DNA identity.

### 2. The Interactive Lobby
The "Lobby" is a real-time, digital aquarium where community members coexist.
- **Autonomous Swarm**: Avatars use flocking algorithms to swim autonomously.
- **Interactive Control**: Users can tap to guide the swarm, creating a shared, playful environment.
- **Live Updates**: See new operatives join and evolve in real-time.

### 3. Operator Dashboard
A command center for managing your digital assets.
- **Visual Status**: View high-fidelity renderings of your Narwhal's current form.
- **Asset Management**: Seamlessly mint, view, and upgrade your assets.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully optimized interface for mobile and desktop command.
